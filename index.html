					On my soul ill put stuff here soon
					So we back in the mine, got our pick axe swinging from side to side,
					Side, side to side
					This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
					Diamonds tonight
					Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body,
					Oh no it's you again,
					I could never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes,
					Eyes, eyes, eyes
					'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,
					'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,
					And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'
					'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again
					Just when you think you're safe, overhear some hissing from right behind,
					Right, right behind
					That's a nice life you have, shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time,
					Time, time, time, time
					Blows up, then your health
					On my soul ill put stuff here soon
