						<div class="title">1 Tooo Jam!</div>
						<p><em>A 2-week-long beginner-friendly game jam aimed at encouraging game development!</em></p>

						<p>Have you ever thought about getting into game development but wanted a proper source of motivation?</p>

						<p>Well, <em>this game jam may be the best fit for you!</em></p>

						<p>Using any game development resources available to you, you have 2 weeks to create a game that fits the announced theme. At the end of the jam period, a game will be picked out and its creators will be the recipients of a <strong><em>₱500 prize!!</em></strong> Sounds life-changing, doesn't it? :-)</p>

						<p>Besides the competitive aspect, however, our primary goal for this event is to encourage more people to pursue game development as a hobby, because it's really fun! We hope that you see this event in the same way, and that you would be able to not only create something new, but also learn a whole lot!</p>

						<p>For the ceremonies, announcements, as well as a good place to chat with other jam participants, please join the Discord server! <a class="textlinks" href="https://discord.gg/vmV2tAe75D">Right here!</a></p>

						<div class="title">Guidelines</div>
						<p>There are no hard rules to what kind of games can be submitted to the game jam, please knock yourself out with whatever genre or type you want! With that, however, please keep the following in mind while making your game:</p>	
						<div class="subtitle">Content</div>
						<ul><li>It is recommended that your game is suitable for a general audience. Please avoid any NSFW imagery or any offensive and hateful depictions and language.</li></ul>

						<div class="subtitle">Assets</div>
						<ul>
							<li>If you are unable to create your own art assets, you may use pre-made assets that you are legally allowed to use. Please credit all of these assets in your game or in the description box of your game.</li>
							<li>You may use pre-existing code and assets from your other projects for use in this game jam. We, however, recommend the idea of starting from scratch! :-)</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="subtitle">Use of Generative AI</div>
						<ul>
							<li>We recommend that generative AI, at the very least, should not be used for creating any art assets for your game.</li>
							<li>We will not discourage the use of generative AI for general coding assistance, but isn't it more fun to go through StackOverflow yourself? :-)</li>
								<ul><li>Not really...</li></ul>
						</ul>

						<div class="subtitle">Accessibility</div>
						<ul>
							<li>To play your game, it is preferable that the game is packaged in an executable (.exe) file instead of compiled, as this could introduce some differences when we play your game. This won't be strictly enforced, but it is heavily encouraged. You may access resources on our site for compiling specific programs into an executable file here: <Link></li>
								<ul><li>If ever an executable file can't be created, please indicate instructions for compilation. We'll try our best to take care of it.</li></ul>
							<li>Your game should, at the very least, be playable with a keyboard and/or mouse. Your game may feature additional support for other peripherals, such as controllers or touchscreen, but we recommend that the game should still be playable without them.</li>
							<li>Your game should, at the very least, be playable on a computer running Windows. This is mainly to make judging easier for us. :P</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="subtitle">Schedule</div>
						<ul>
							<li>The jam kicks off on <strong><u>August 16, 2025 (Saturday)</u></strong> @ <strong><u>8:00PM UTC+8</u></strong>, and submissions for the jam will open at the same time.</li>
								<ul><li>A jam-opening ceremony will take place in the Discord starting about an hour earlier to announce the theme.</li></ul>
